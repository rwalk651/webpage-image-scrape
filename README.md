<h1 align="center">Webpage Image Scraper</h1>

Webpage Image Scraper is a simple Python application intended to automate downloading wallpapers from specific sites. 

The project uses Selenium and Pillow to navigate webpages, save urls, and download images. This is a personal project
meant to brush up on my Python skills.
